## Where Our Story Begins

The crisp air of the ocean breeze wraps around my hair and body as if she is embracing me in a warm hug. As I stare out into the waves you loved to play in, I can still hear your sweet laugh ringing in my head. This beach is your new home, and it will always remind me of your favorite place. For now, I await the day when I wake up in the clouds with you by my side. [^1]

## My Amazing Girl

You blessed me with a life rich of laughter, singing, and dancing. I feel your spirit reemerge in our home when I listen to all the videos you made me take of you, giving the most special performances. You showed us all how to live freely and embrace silliness. [^1]

## In Later Years

I lay away at night wondering about the ways that you would have changed the world we live in. Hope remains in my spirit but diminishes over time since everything becomes dimmer. I imagine you to have emerged as a philosophical and wise woman. You would have embraced motherhood openly and allowed your nurturing abilities to flourish. [^1]

 ## The Memories That Remain
 
Your infectious spirit carries me on through the darkest days. You loved to be center stage in everyone's life. Dressing up in funky hats and pretending to be walking on the runway while we watched and cheered. You brought a sense of confidence and personality that those far older than you would be envious of.

## The Darkest Storm

When the deepest sorrow strikes me, I feel as if someone's hands are clasped around my neck so tight that my throat closes, and I can no longer breathe. I question all that I believed to be true in my life every day. The stormy clouds remind me of your cries that will forever haunt me as you became more and more ill. All I prayed for was for the grey clouds to hide away and for you to come home to me. [^1]
