## Where our story begins

The crisp air of the ocean breeze wraps around my hair and body as if she is embracing me in a warm hug. As I stare out into the waves you loved to play in, I can still hear your sweet laugh ringing in my head. This beach is your new home that will always remind me of your favorite place. For now, I await the day when I wake up in the clouds with you by my side.

## My amazing girl

You blessed me with a life full of laughter, singing, and dancing. I feel your spirit reemerge in our home when I listen to all the videos you made me take of you, giving the most special performances. You showed us all how to live freely and embrace silliness.

## Your joyous spirit

From the moment you learned to talk, you wanted to spread your vivacious spirit to everyone around you. I always feared that someone might steal you away because you loved to chat with anyone you could find in the park. The animals we saw were your favorite part of it all; especially the doggies you spent hours with.

 ## The memories I'm left with
 
 Your infectious spirit carries me on through the darkest days. You loved to be center stage in everyone's life. Dressing up in funky hats and pretending to be walking on the runway while we watched and cheered. You brought a sense of confidence and personality that those far older than you would be envious of.

## The darkest storm

When the deepest sorrow strikes me, I feel as if someone's hands are clasped around my neck so tight that my throat closes, and I can no longer breathe. The stormy clouds remind me of your cries that will forever haunt me when you became more and more ill. All I prayed for was for the grey clouds to hide away and for you to feel better again.
